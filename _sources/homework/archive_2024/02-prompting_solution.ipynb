    "## Experiment Scheme\n",
    "In our experiments we worked on the following configurations:\n",
    "* Two models, `pythia-410m` and `pythia-1.4b` are used to generate the output.\n",
    "* Few-shot examples are collected from two different datasets: [CommonSenseQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tau/commonsense_qa) and [NumerSense](https://inklab.usc.edu/NumerSense/) dataset. CommonsenseQA is a multiple-choice question answering dataset that requires different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers . It contains 12,102 questions with one correct answer and four distractor answers. NumerSense is a numerical commonsense reasoning probing task, with a diagnostic dataset consisting of 3,145 masked-word-prediction probes.\n",
    "* We primarily explored two prompting techniques: Generated Knowledge Prompting (with few-shot examples) and Few-shot Prompting. In Generated Knowledge Prompting, the approach involves generating knowledge statements pertaining to the given question. Subsequently, we evaluate the log probability of each answer option being generated given these knowledge statements. This methodology enables the model to either support or oppose its own answer. We also employ two output extraction techniques: scoring the answers based on log-probabilities and classical generation. Classical generation utilizes the log-probabilities to generate new tokens. Hence, these approaches initially appear similar. However, the former allows us to constrain the model's output to only one of the options, thereby limiting its output possibilities. We worked on the following combinations:\n",
    "  * Generated Knowledge Prompting with NumerSense dataset + scoring\n",
    "  * Generated Knowledge Prompting with CommonSenseQA dataset + scoring\n",
    "  * Few Shot Learning with CommonSenseQA dataset + scoring\n",
    "  * Few Shot Learning with CommonSenseQA dataset + classical generation (softmax sampling)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the generated knowledge prompting, we generated five knowledge statements for each question. For each answer choice 𝑎, we identified the knowledge statement that best supports it by calculating the log probability of generating that answer for each augmented prompt (with the knowledge statement). This process allows us to determine the maximum probability for each answer. Ultimately, we select the answer with the highest maximum probability.\n",

    "> ### Answers\n",
    "> #### How were words / tokens represented? What is the difference / similarity to modern LLMs?\n",
    ">A continuous real-vector for each word was used to represent similarity between words (instead of using discrete random or deterministic variables). That way, each word is associated with a specific point in the vector space, while the number of features is smaller than the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "That idea reminds of the feature vectors used in information retrieval. However, here we are looking at the probability distribution of word sequences from natural language text.\n",
    "Like the Bengio et al. paper, LLMs using a vector representation. However, modern LLMs work with context-sensitive embeddings. Also, they divide the word into sub words. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### How was the context represented? What is the difference / similarity to modern LLMs?\n",
    ">The vector, that is learnt to represent a word, is based on the preceding context. This follows the intuition that words, which occur in similar contexts, have similar meaning.\n",
    "In contrast Modern LLMs work with self-attention and Transformers. They also use much wider context-windows, than the model decribed here.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### What is the curse of dimensionality? Give a concrete example in the context of language modelling.\n",
    ">The curse of dimensionality occurs while analysing data in high-dimensional spaces. When the dimensionality rises, the volume of the space increases exponentially. The Problem is that words, which are similar, will still be different in high dimensial space. This is because even though they appear relatively often in simialar contexts, most of the contexts will still be different, if we consider every possible context. \n",
    "One example is a joint distribution of 10 consecutive words with a vocabulary size of 100,000. Here we have 100,000^10-1 = 10^50-1 free parameters. \n",
    "This model is using a joint probability function of word feature vector sequences which is a smooth function of this feature values with a neural network. \n",
    "Doing so, the method is crucially different to modern LLMs.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Which training data was used? What is the difference / similarity to modern LLMs?\n",
    ">The training set is a sequence of words, the vocabulary large but finite. \n",
    "Comparative experiments were performed on the Brown corpus, where the first 800,000 words were used for the training data set. \n",
    "Furthermore, a experiment was run on the Associated Press News texts, where the training set consist of a stream of about 14 million words.\n",
    "The training data of Modern LLMs is much larger and much more diverse. \n",

    "> #### Abstract\n",
    "> Similar in both papers: introducing problem and solution.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Introduction\n",
    "> Bengio et al. describes the challenges of statistical modelling and offers a neural network solution. A special focus is here the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "Devlin et al. explains the limitation of existing pre-trained techniques and introduced BERT. \n",
    "> Therefore, Bengio et al. introduce a new theoretical framework whereas Denvio et. al introduces an entire alternative model.\n",
    "> Bengio et al. looks into earlier neural networks and statistical models whereas Devlin et al. focus on feature based models like ELMo.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### A neural model\n",
    "> Bengio et al. describes a neural network architecture. Devlin et al. explains a pre-trained transformer with a giant corpus, masked language modelling and finetuning.\n",
    "> Both papers are explaining there architecture detailed and with pictures. But Bengio et al. give a much more detailed description of the theoretical background, while Devlin et al. presuppose knowledge about general transformer architecture and emphasize the diffenrencs and improvements of BERT.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Parallel Implementation\n",
    "> Bengio et al. emphasizes parallel computation where the hardware no longer exists. There is no comaprable section in the paper of Devlin et al.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Experimental Results\n",
    "> Bengio et al. uses only perplexity reduction on the Brown dataset and the AP News Corpora. The paper also compares to SOTA.  Devlin et al. uses different NLP benchmarks.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Extensions and Future Work\n",
    "> Bengio et al. describes different possible improvements that can be tried out in the future. Devlin et al.is keeping this part very short. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### Conclusion\n",
    "> Both papers summarize their break throughs. Nonetheless, the conclusion in the BERT paper is shorter than in the paper introducing the neural network solution.\n"
