    "> 2. [4pts] We want to train a neural network that takes as input two numbers $x_1, x_2$, passes them through three hidden linear layers, each with 13 neurons, each followed by the ReLU activation function, and outputs three numbers $y_1, y_2, y_3$. Write down all weight matrices of this network with their dimensions. (Example: if one weight matrix has the dimensions 3x5, write $M_1\\in R^{3\\times5}$) \n",
    "> 3. [2pts] Consider the sequence: \"Input: Some students trained each language model\". Assuming that each word+space/punctuation corresponds to one token, consider the following token probabilities of this sequence under some trained language model: $p = [0.67, 0.91, 0.83, 0.40, 0.29, 0.58, 0.75]$. Compute the average surprisal of this sequence under that language model. [Note: in this class we always assume the base $e$ for $log$, unless indicated otherwise. This is also usually the case throughout NLP.]"

We will evaluate the performance of the model on our test split of the dataset over training to monitor whether the model's performance is improving and compare the performance of the base pretrained GPT-2 and the fine-tuned model.
