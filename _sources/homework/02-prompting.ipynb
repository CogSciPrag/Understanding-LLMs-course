    "The lecture discussed various sophisticated ways of prompting language models for generating texts. Please answer the following questions about prompting techniques in context of different models, and write down your answers, briefly explaining them (max. 3 sentences). Feel free to actually implement some of the prompting strategies to play around with them and build your intuitions.\n",

    "> For each model, which strategies do you think work well, and why? Do you think there are particular tasks or contexts, in which they work better, than in others?"

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you can let your creativity flow -- your task is to come up with prompts for language models such that they achieve maximal accuracy on the following example tasks. Feel free to take inspiration from the in-class examples of the sentiment classification task. Also feel free to play around with the decoding scheme and see how it interacts with the different prompts.\n",

    "    * High fashion ladies wait outside a tram beside a crowd of people in the city. The women do not care what clothes they wear. contradiction\n",
    "  * Multiple choice QA: the task is to predict the correct answer option for the question, given the question and the options (like in the task of Ex. 3 of homework 1). The gold labels are provided for reference here, but obviously shouldn't be given to the model at test time.\n",

    "Next to reading and understanding package documentations, a key skill for NLP researchers and practitioners is reading and critically assessing NLP literature. The density, but also the style of NLP literature has undergone a significant shift in the recent years with increasing acceleration of progress. Your task in this exercise is to read a paper about one of the first successful neural langauge models, understand its key architectural components and compare how these key components have evolved in modern systems that were discussed in the lecture. \n",
