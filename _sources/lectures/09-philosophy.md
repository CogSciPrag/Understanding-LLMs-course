# Implications, Understanding & Philosophy

This session takes a more in-depth, even philosophical, perspective on *what it means to actually understand something*. Here, we focus on what it means to really understand language, and discuss whether LLMs can be said to *understand* language in the discussed senses of "understanding".

Slides of the session can be found [here](https://github.com/CogSciPrag/Understanding-LLMs-course/tree/main/understanding-llms/lectures/slides/09-implications-understanding-philosophy.pdf).
