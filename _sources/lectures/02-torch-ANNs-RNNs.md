# PyTorch, ANNs & LMs

Slides from the second lecture introducing artificial neural nets (ANNs), the concept of language models (LMs) and early LMs implemented as recurrent neural networks & LSTMs can be found [here](https://github.com/CogSciPrag/Understanding-LLMs-course/tree/main/understanding-llms/lectures/slides/02-PyTorch-ANNs-RNNs.pdf).

## Additional materials

If you want to dig a bit deeper, here are two (optional!) readings, a general textbook on deep learning and the paper that first introduced backpropagation for training neural networks:

* [Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016) Deep learning (textbook)](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [Rumelhart et al. (1986) Learning representations by back-propagating errors](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0)
