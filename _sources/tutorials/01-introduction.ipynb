    "* preparing the Python requirements for practical exercises in the upcoming tutorials,\n",
    "* test-running a few lines of code,\n",

    "Throughout the semester, we will use Python, PyTorch and various packages for practical work. Both the in-tutorial exercise sheets and homework will require you to execute Python code yourself.\n",
    "Please follow the steps below to set up the requirements (i.e., most packages required for completing exercises) that we will use in the course. We will have to install more packages as we go during the semester, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do so either on your own machine, or by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can easily access the latter option by pressing the Colab icon at the top of the webook's page. Depending on your choice, please follow the respective requirement installation steps below."

    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Colab is that you don't need to install software on your own machine; i.e., it is a safer option if you are not very comfortable with using Python on your own machine. Colab is a  platform provided by Google for free, and it also provides limited access to GPU computation (which will be useful fpor working with actual language models). Using it only requires a Google account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For using a GPU on Colab, before executing your code, navigate to Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU > Save. Please note that the provided Colab computational resources are free, so please be mindful when using them. Further, Colab monitors GPU usage, so if it is used a lot very frequently, the user might not be able to access GPU run times for a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "Colab already provides Python as well as a number of basic packages. If you choose to use it, you will only need to install the more specific packages. Note that you will have to so *every time* you open a new Colab runtime. To test that you can access requirements for the class, please open this notebook in Colab (see above), uncomment and run the following line:"

    "### Local installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your computer for local execution of all practical exercises might be a more advanced option. If you do so, we strongly encourage you to create an environment (e.g., with Conda) before installing any packages. Furthermore, ideally, check if you have a GPU suitable for deep learning because using a GPU will significantly speed up the work with language models. You can do so by checking your computer specs and finding out whether your GPU works with CUDA, MPS or ROCm. If you don't have a suitable GPU, you can use Colab for tasks that require GPU access. Finally, please note that we will download some pretrained models and some datasets which will occupy some of your local storage.\n",
