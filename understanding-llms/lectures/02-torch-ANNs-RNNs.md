# PyTorch, ANNs & LMs

Stay tuned for slides from the second lecture!

## Additional materials

If you want to dig a bit deeper, here are two (optional!) readings, a general textbook on deep learning and the paper that first introduced backpropagation for training neural networks:

* [Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville (2016) Deep learning (textbook)](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [Rumelhart et al. (1986) Learning representations by back-propagating errors](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0)
