    "## Decoding schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of this sheet is a close replication of [this](https://michael-franke.github.io/npNLG/06-LSTMs/06d-decoding-GPT2.html) sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic addresses the following question: Given a language model that outputs a next-word probability, how do we use this to actually generate naturally sounding text? For that, we need to choose a single next token from the distribution, which we will then feed back to the model, together with the preceding tokens, so that it can generate the next one. This inference procedure is repeated, until the EOS token is chosen, or a maximal sequence length is achieved. The procedure of how exactly to get that single token from the distribution is call *decoding scheme*. Note that \"decoding schemes\" and \"decoding strategies\" refer to the same concept and are used interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already discussed decoding schemes in lecture 02 (slide 25). The following introduces these schemes in more detail again and provides example code for configuring some of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "> <strong><span style=&ldquo;color:#D83D2B;&rdquo;>Exercise 3.3.1: Decoding schemes</span></strong>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Please read through the following introduction and look at the provided code. \n",
    "> 1. With the help of the example and the documentation, please complete the code (where it says \"### YOUR CODE HERE ####\") for all the decoding schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common decoding strategies are:\n",
    "* **pure sampling**: In a pure sampling approach, we just sample each next word with exactly the probability assigned to it by the LM. Notice that this process, therefore, is non-determinisitic. We can force replicable results, though, by setting a *seed*.\n",
    "* **Softmax sampling**: In soft-max sampling, the probablity of sampling word $w_i$ is $P_{LM} (w_i \\mid w_{1:i-1}) \\propto \\exp(\\frac{1}{\\tau} P_{LM}(w_i \\mid w_{1:i-1}))$, where $\\tau$ is a *temperature parameter*.\n",
    "  * The *temperature parameter* is also often available for closed-source models like the GPT family. It is often said to change the \"creativity\" of the output.\n",
    "* **greedy sampling**: In greedy sampling, we donâ€™t actually sample but just take the most likely next-word at every step. Greedy sampling is equivalent to setting $\\tau = 0$ for soft-max sampling. It is also sometimes referred to as *argmax* decoding.\n",
    "* **beam search**: In simplified terms, beam search is a parallel search procedure that keeps a number $k$ of path probabilities open at each choice point, dropping the least likely as we go along. (There is actually no unanimity in what exactly beam search means for NLG.)\n",
    "* **top-$k$ sampling**: his sampling scheme looks at the $k$ most likely next-words and samples from so that: $$P_{\\text{sample}}(w_i  \\mid w_{1:i-1}) \\propto \\begin{cases} P_{M}(w_i \\mid w_{1:i-1}) & \\text{if} \\; w_i \\text{ in top-}k \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "* **top-$p$ sampling**: Top-$p$ sampling is similar to top-$k$ sampling, but restricts sampling not to the top-$k$ most likely words (so always the same number of words), but the set of most likely words the summed probability of which does not exceed threshold $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The within the `transformers` package, for all causal LMs, the `.generate()` function is available which allows to sample text from the model (remember the brief introduction in [sheet 2.5](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/tutorials/02e-intro-to-hf.html)). Configuring this function via different values and combinations of various parameters allows to sample text with the different decoding schemes described above. The respective documentation can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.40.2/en/generation_strategies#decoding-strategies). The same configurations can be passed to the `pipeline` endpoint which we have seen in the same sheet."
