    "## Introduction: ML models\n",
    "In the previous sheets, we have learned how to explicitly define neural networks and recurrent language models using native PyTorch. Further, we have seen the core steps of machine learning workflows with any kind of model, in general:\n",
    "1. prepare data (sheet 1.1, respective steps in sheets 2.2-2.4)\n",
    "2. define model architecture (i.e., define which layers with which parameters the network should have)\n",
    "3. train model on data\n",
    "4. evaluate model (sheet 2.4; more on evaluation of language models to come in future sessions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the single steps differ by application (e.g., we use different kinds of data nad models to train an image classifier vs. to train a language model), but the general structure of the process is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this background, in principle, you should be able to put together any well-known neural network yourself! (e.g., implement Llama-3 or GPT-3)! (assuming sufficient time and access to information like PyTorch docs, details of the architecture, maybe some concepts from the next lecture, of course)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, putting together the network (i.e., specifying all the layers, their sizes, implementing the forward pass through the net etc.) does *not* mean that you will be able to use the model for generating predictions in practice. Generating predictions (= running inference) on new inputs (e.g., predicting continuations of new input texts or classifying new images) is the purpose of creating a machine learning model -- we build them because we want to automate these tasks. Ideally, we want the model to *generalize well* -- to be able to handle inputs for that the model was not trained on and still perform the task correctly (e.g., produce a sensible text completion for an entirely new text input).\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating predictions, we need the **trained** model, i.e., we need not just the definition of the model, but also the *model weights* set to optimized values that result from (successful) training. That is, we need the values of all the weight matrices (we have seen those in sheet 2.3). In practice, successful training of state-of-the-art models is quite costly and data-hungry (at least for creating actually useful models).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: The practical sheets will try to be consistent and use the term \"architecture\" to refer to the more abstract definition, carcass, of a model (i.e,. the specific layer types and parameterizations underlying the model), and the term \"model\" for the particular instatiation with particular weights of that model configuration. When referring to a specific model instance, there are different important concepts / terms:\n",
    "* **pretrained** model: this is commonly used in the domains of NLP and computer vision (CV) where models are usually first trained on a very large collection of data to learn their task (in general). In the context of NLP, this refers to a model that has been trained to predict the next word on a large collection of text (e.g., on the Pile which we have seen in sheet 1.1). On a high level, this step can be thought of as the step where the model learns to predict fluent language in general. In the context of CV, this often refers to a model that has been trained to classify images on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
    "* **fine-tuned** model: this refers to a pretrained model that has been further trained on a *task-specific*, or, generally curated and therefore, usually smaller, dataset. This step can be thought of as optimizing the model for a particular task, like predicting texts in a particular domain (e.g., movie reviews). This is usually done based on a pretrained model because curated datasets are often too small to learn a task from scratch well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"trained\" model will be mostly used as an umbrella terms for both types of models."

    "## HuggingFace ðŸ¤—\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there are many popular *open-source* models, i.e., those for which the architecture and the weights have been made freely accessible by the developers: e.g., GPT-2, the LLama models, BERT etc. In contrast, e.g., GPT-4 is *closed-source* -- we don't know exactly which layers with which configurations are inside the model and we cannot access the weights ourselves; they are only hosted by OpenAI and we can send our input data to their servers and get back predictions (by using the OpenAI API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-source models are frequently used by the community and have been made available via platforms and packages which provide an easy interface for loading pretrained models, generating predictions from these pretrained models, or training models from scratch. The by-far most used platform for open-source resources which we will heavily use in this course is [**HuggingFace**](https://huggingface.co/). HuggingFace provides infrastructure for working with many different types of machine learning models (for working with audio, vision, language tasks), but, as you might guess, we will be focusing on functionality relevant to language modeling. HuggingFace will often be abbreviated as HF throughout the sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a high-level overview of all the nice things that HuggingFace provides: \n",
    "* (most relevant for us) the packages [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) and [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) which we already installed alst week. These allow easy access and workflow with models and with datasets.\n",
    "  * Overviews, guides, tutorials for different tasks that can be done with `transformers`, docs for different models as well as the documentation of the API can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).\n",
    "  * The same resources for `datasets` can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).\n",
    "* The (online) HF platform called HuggingFace Hub actually stores trained model weights (also sometimes called checkpoints) and datasets. They are downloaded to the local machine when accessed through the `transformers` or `datasets` package. Available models can be browsed [here](https://huggingface.co/models); available datasets can be browsed [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets). \n",
    "  * In order to *upload* yourown resources to HF Hub and in order to access some models (inclding LLama-2), you need a free account. It can easily be created on HF. So far, an account is not required for following the class.\n",
    "* The platform provides much more (feel free to explore! but also try not to feel overwhlemed if you are seeing HF for the first time). Here are some highlights most relevant to the course:\n",
    "  * [NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) which includes practical tutorials for common NLP tasks with transformers.\n",
    "  * [`evaluate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/index) package for computing common evaluation metrics (more on this in the next sessions)\n",
    "  * (more advanced) packages for [accelerated](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) and parallelized training on GPUs, via parameter-efficient fine-tuning ([PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index)) and more. \n",
    "  * `tokenizers` [package](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index). However, we will only use functionality of pretrained tokenizers which are shipped together with models via transformers.\n"

It essentially \"infers\" the architecture from a configuration file that is retrieved when a model is downloaded from HF. In the next tutorials, you will often see subclasses of this being used. You can find more (optional) information [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto)."
