Specifically, we will use the package [`langchain`](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/) and its extensions to build our own LLM systems and explore their functionality. The learning goals for this sheet are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* understanding basics of langchain \n",
    "* trying out langchain agents and tools \n",
    "* understanding the basics of output processing \n",
    "* familiarization with basic handling of agent memory\n",

    "Langchain is under heavy development. Sometimes examples provided in the docs break with version updates, so one needs to be somewhat patient. \n",

    "## LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture discussed that modern LLMs can be viewed as building blocks of larger systems, be it for engineering or research purposes. In particular, one might want to use an LLM and make several calls (i.e., several inference passses) to it, and somehow use the predicted results together to complete one's task. Note that when we talk about such systems, we (almost always) use the LLM for *inference*, i.e., the LLM is already pretrained / fine-tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the terminology of langchain, a sequence of such LLM calls is called a *chain*. For each call, one minimally needs to specify a (pretrained / fine-tuned) LLM and a prompt that specifies what exactly the call should accomplish. For the prompt, oftentimes *prompt templates* are used. These prompt templates usually specify *variables* which are filled with inputs when the respective LLM call is invoked. The idea behind this is that the calls can be re-used, e.g., with various user inputs, without having to re-type the entire prompt. Further, these inputs may come from a previous LLM call. One neat feature of langchain is that it allows to seamlessly chain LLM calls and stream outputs from one call into the next. Specific types of templates (e.g., chat prompt templates) also take care of formatting text in the way expected by the model, e.g., adding the required special tokens and format for chat models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Disclaimer: Not sponsored by LangChain -- there are other very useful tools for doing such things, for instance, XXXX. This is just one popular example.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will first look at a an example of a simple sequence of LLM calls. In particular, we will build a system that helps us to come up with a dinner menu, given some ingredients that we already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the OpenAI API to get optimal performance (specifically, the GPT-3.5-turbo model). Instructions for retreiving the an API key will be provided in class."
