Write down all weight matrices of this network with their dimensions. (Example: if one weight matrix has the dimensions 3x5, write $M_1\\in R^{3\\times5}$) \n",

    "The learning goal of this exercise is to practice fine-tuning a pretrained LM, GPT-2 small, for a particular task, namely commonsense question answering (QA). We will use a task-specific dataset, [CommonsenseQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tau/commonsense_qa), that was introduced by [Talmor et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00937). We will evaluate the performance of the model on our test split of the dataset over training to monitor whether the model's performance is improving and compare the performance of the base pretrained GPT-2 and the fine-tuned model. We will need to perform the following steps: \n",
