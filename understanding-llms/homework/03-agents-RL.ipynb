    "## Exercise 1: Building a retrieval-augmented generation system (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "An increasingly popular approach to language generation is so called *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG) wherein a language model is supplied with additional (textual) information retrieved from some storage, in addition to the actual task query. It has been found that this additional context improves model performance, and, e.g., allows to use LLMs with custom information (e.g., proprietary documents etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "The general set up of a RAG system is as follows:\n",
    "1. Some form of a database (DB) with (searchable) relevant background information (e.g., a database, a set of documents, ...) is created.\n",
    "   1. A common database format are *vector DBs*, or, vectore stores. You can optionally learn more about vector DBs, e.g., here: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/. The important conceptual point is that some form of a searchable database with relevant (textual) information is created.\n",
    "2. An LLM that will be generating the responses to the queries, given context, is chosen.\n",
    "3. An embedding model is chosen.\n",
    "4. Task queries (e.g., questions or instructions) are provided to the system. \n",
    "   1. The query is converted to an embedding (using the model chosen ins tep 3), and the embedding is used to search and retrieve relevant information from the database. The specific retrieval method depnds on the nature of the database.\n",
    "   2. The relevant information is supplied to the LLM as context.\n",
    "5. Given the extended context, the LLM provides output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is visualized in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",

    "**YOUR TASK**\n",
    "> Your task in this exercise is to explore RAG by implementing a RAG system for recipe generation. The implemented RAG system should be compared to the performance of the same model in a \"vanilla\" set-up where the model solves the task directly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We will use the package `LlamaIndex` and the LLM `phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model as the backbone for the implementation. We will use the `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model as our embedding model.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> We will use unstructured data in the form of a recipe dataset `m3hrdadfi/recipe_nlg_lite`. This dataset will be indexed and it will be used to supplement information for the LLM, additionally to the query. The train split of the dataset should be used for the index, and a sample from the test dataset will be used for sampling queries with which the system will be tested. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> For this task, please complete the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Download the dataset from Huggingface. \n",

Specifically, the baseline is simultaneously learned during training, and learns to predict the so-called action value, namely the expected reward for generating a particular completion, given the query. This baseline is implemented as an additional (scalar output) head next to the next-token prediction head of the policy, and is called the value head. Based on the query and completion representation, it learns to predict a scalar reward which is compared to the ground truth reward from the reward model."

[Bonus 2pts] The overall loss that is optimized during training with PPO consists of two components: the policy loss that is computed based on the completion log probability and the reward, and the value function loss which is computed based on the the predicted and received reward for a completion. These two loss components are weighed in the total loss function with the value function coefficient (`vf_coef`). Intuitively, how does it affect training if the coefficient is set to a high value? "
